#### Considerations

- DDD design, closer to the anemic model
- API first approach, controller interfaces and api objects will be generated by the given opeanapi.yml document with OpenApiGenerator
- Swagger for easier testing and REST representation
- Java 21 without the experimental features for fun
- Lombok for reducing boilerplate code
- Mapstruct for reducing boilerplate code of the mappers between the api and domain models
- Spring Validation (with Hibernate Validation) for API validation, no persistence validation at this task.
- JPA for the persistence
- H2 database for lightweight db and testing
- Testing the whole application with SpringBootTest

#### Exercise design
- During the task we can book 'time' in a calendar, that's why this app called `Calendar`.
- Booked time is called `Event`, available timeslots called `TimeSlot`
- For the simplicity, some overlap is allowed in the database, one `event's` end time can be the same as the next `event's` end time.
- While querying the events by its exact end time, the query won't return it, since it is considered as ended.
