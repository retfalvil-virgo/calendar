Homework for Allianz Technologies

#### Considerations

- DDD design, closer to the anemic model
- API first approach, controller interfaces and api objects will be generated by the given opeanapi.yml document with OpenApiGenerator
- Swagger for easier testing and REST representation
- Java 21 without the experimental features for fun
- Lombok for reducing boilerplate code
- Mapstruct for reducing boilerplate code of the mappers between the api and domain models
- Spring Validation (with Hibernate Validation) for API validation, no persistence validation at this task.
- JPA for the persistence
- H2 database for lightweight db and testing
- Testing the whole application with SpringBootTest
